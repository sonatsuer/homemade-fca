# Homemade Formal Concept Analysis

A small page generating a formal concept lattice from a CSV and render it using [Mermaid](https://www.mermaidchart.com/). For an introduction to formal concept analysis see the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis).

The uploaded CSV is interpreted as a formal context where non-empty cells are interpreted as marking
that the object has the attribute. If a cell has the empty string, then it is interpreted as the
opposite.

Generated Mermaid source can be copy-pasted from the page to be imported in another tool.
